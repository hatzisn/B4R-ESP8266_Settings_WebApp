# B4R-ESP8266_Settings_WebApp

Normally one would answer to the question if it is possible to create a fully functioning fully responsive ESP8266 settings webapp in the board that this is impossible. And it is (as far as my knowledge goes). So if you can't go through an obstacle just go around it. The solution is to create the web app in B4J and when you reach through your browser to your ESP8266 board it sends you a brief html code with an iFrame pointing to the WebApp passing also an id parameter. The web app is MQTT enabled both as broker and as a client and the board connects through MQTT to it and subscribes to the Topic with a name as the ID. To the same topic subscribes also the WebApp when the socket is connected as it gets it from the parameter passed. This ensures the return path to the board from the WebApp of the settings.
